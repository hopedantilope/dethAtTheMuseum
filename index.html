              <p>The heart is an organ that is part of the cardiovascular system, which also includes arteries and
                veins. The heart is connected to both the pulmonary and systemic blood circulation. In humans, the heart
                is divided into four chambers: the upper left and right atria and the lower left and right ventricles.
                The heart also consists of valves, which in a healthy heart ensure one-directional blood flow and
                prevent backflow. Another form of protection for the heart is the pericardium, which encloses the entire
                organ. The wall of the heart is composed of three layers: the epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium.

                blood from the entire body enters the heart through the superior and inferior vena cava and flows into
                the right atrium. From the right atrium, the deoxygenated blood is pumped into the right ventricle and
                then sent through the pulmonary circulation to the lungs. In the lungs, the blood receives oxygen and,
                in its oxygenated form, flows back to the heart into the left atrium. From this point onward, the blood
                enters the systemic circulation.</p>

              <p>Oxygenated blood from the lungs enters the heart through the left atrium and is then pumped into the

                through the aorta to the entire body. The function of oxygenated blood is to flow through arteries and
                arterioles and deliver oxygen to all parts of the body. Oxygen is carried by red blood cells through the
                hemoglobin molecule. In the tissues, oxygen is delivered to the cells, while carbon dioxide moves from
                the tissues into the blood, causing the blood to become deoxygenated again. The deoxygenated blood then
                flows back to the heart through venules and veins, which connect to the superior and inferior vena cava,
                and enters the heart through the right atrium. This cycle repeats continuously.</p>

                heart's pacemaker. These cells produce an electrical impulse, which travels through the electrical

                vessels. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the
                leading cause of death worldwide. CVDs account for an estimated 19.8 million deaths each year (data
                from 2022). More than four out of five CVD-related deaths are caused by heart attacks and strokes, and
                one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Besides the CVDs heart
                can also suffer from other diseases including: heart valve disorder (failure of a valve to close
                completely), arrhythmias (irregular rhythms), heart failure (poor pumping), congenital heart defect.

              <p>The heart muscle itself is nourished by oxygenated blood supplied through the coronary arteries. If
                blood flow in one of these arteries decreases significantly or stops completely, it can cause an
                infarction (tissue death) of the heart muscle.</p>
              <p>The first phase occurs when the coronary arteries become damaged due to various risk factors. These
                risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of physical activity, obesity, high
                blood cholesterol, poor diet, and excessive alcohol intake. Over time, these factors damage the
                coronary arteries.</p>
              <p>In the next phase, the body attempts to repair the damaged arteries. Blood cell fragments called
                platelets attach to the damaged area of the artery and may clump together to form blood clots. If a
                clot becomes large enough, it can partially or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery
                and cause a heart attack.</p>

              <p>I am just the heart, but it doesn't beat anymore. I just used to smoke, but I don't smoke anymore. They
                told me, as I now tell you, that smoking eventually ends you! – like making that red-beating heart fall
                silent. How much does each cigarette shorten life? 20 minutes. I started smoking at 15 and quit at 55.
                That's 40 years of cigarettes. How many cigarettes did I smoke on average each day? Hmm, say about 20 a
                day then. 20 * 20 = 400 minutes a day. In that sense, I shortened my life by 6,6 hours every day. I died
                later, of a heart attack, at 60, even after 5 years smoke-free. Was it worth it? No way, but at the same
                time: smoking isn't just smoking, you know? What made me smoke? What did smoking mean to me? Listen: I
                think we live in a society where who and what you're not is more important than what you are. I don't
                smoke, I don't eat candy on weekdays, I'm not a guy who doesn't donate organs, I don't skip the bus
                fare, I'm not boisterous, I don't swallow gum, I don't leave food on my plate even when I'm full – I am
                not. Not not, not? So how hard was my heart really beating while it was still beating? Maybe smoking was
                the last beat in a sea of no-beat. I am a smoker. Not someone who doesn't not smoke, but a smoker. That
                idea makes me smile - sadly, but still. Why did I choose to quit at 55? I have, in a way, always
                surrendered; I've always been a body with parts that others can't get enough of. I surrendered to the
                plumbing trade, to the place where my wife wanted to live, and now I have surrendered my organs to you.
                At last I even surrendered smoking. The transition isn't that great, if you know what I mean? Still: I
                am not a person who doesn't donate his organs. It's strange, isn't it?</p>
